## Description

Chomper is a lightweight ad-blocking project that combines:

- A **desktop installer** (Python based)  
- A **browser extension** Chomper blocks ads with high accuracy on major video-streaming sites (yes… yt 😉), while staying lightweight and unobtrusive.
---

## Why Chomper

Most ad blockers are heavy, complex, or intrusive. Chomper focuses on:

- **Efficiency:** Keeps *yt* watch sessions clean by quietly chomping through ads
- **Simplicity:** Easy to install and use, with no unnecessary configuration  
- **Clarity:** A clean and well-organized structure that is easy for both users and developers to understand
